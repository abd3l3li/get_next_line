I often wonder what the trees
Who in their silence seemed
To always have the sound of these
Confounding clamor of troubled dreams?
Are close together as in days
That suffer the weather's inclement
Tempers, struck by their darkly face
That withers and rumbles in the cloud,
And limps & hobbles through the air.
These trees are gently poised and proud
